A full-fledged Telegram bot with registration and users profiles. The bot was initially developed for personal use, as I didn't want to enable/disable VPN every time I needed to use ChatGPT. However, it also includes a request control system and the ability to monitor user traffic, allowing the bot to be used not only for personal use but also for mass usage through a tariff system and limitations on the number of requests.

The bot is built using the OpenAI API and the Node Telegram Bot API. Users have access to settings where they can control all the parameters provided by OpenAI, such as temperature, top_p, context, service info, and others.

Currently, the bot is running locally, and I launch it on localhost as needed. There is no public deployment as I haven't found a good free hosting solution. If you're interested in testing it, please contact me directly for the launch at [@gusso](https://t.me/gusso).
